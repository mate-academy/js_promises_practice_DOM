    - There are no tests for this task so use `npm run lint` command instead of `npm test`

### Task: Promises practice

In this task, you should create 3 promises.
1. The first promise should be resolved on a `click` in `document` or rejected in 5 seconds if not clicked.
2. The second promise should be resolved only on `left` or `right` click on `document`. `middle` button should be ignored.
3. The third promise should be resolved only if both `left` and `right` clicks happened.

That's all.

Hint: It doesn't matter in what way you choose to notify users about resolved or rejected promises. You can use DOM or `console.log`.
